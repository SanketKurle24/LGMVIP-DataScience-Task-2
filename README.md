Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

Here, I have analysed the stock value of TATA GLOBAL from the National Stock Exchange. 
For each date, the Opening Value of the stock, Highest and Lowest values of that stock on the same days are noted, along with the Closing Value at the end of the day.

Long Short Term Memory

Long Short-Term Memory models are extremely powerful time-series models. They can predict an arbitrary number of steps into the future.

Steps used in prediction and forecasting stocks
Step 1 – Importing the Libraries
Step 2 – Getting Visualising the Data
Step 3 – Print the DataFrame Shape and Check for Null Values. 
Step 4 – Plotting the True Adjusted Close Value 
Step 5 – Setting the Target Variable and Selecting the Features
Step 6 – Scaling
Step 7 – Splitting to a Training Set and Test Set.
Step 8 – Processing the Data For LSTM
Step 9 – Building the LSTM Model
Step 10 – Training the Model
Step 11 – LSTM Prediction
Step 12 – True vs Predicted Adj Close Value – LSTM
