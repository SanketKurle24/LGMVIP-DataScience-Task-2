Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

Here, I have analysed the stock value of TATA GLOBAL from the National Stock Exchange. 
For each date, the Opening Value of the stock, Highest and Lowest values of that stock on the same days are noted, along with the Closing Value at the end of the day.

Long Short Term Memory

Long Short-Term Memory models are extremely powerful time-series models. They can predict an arbitrary number of steps into the future.

Steps used in prediction and forecasting stocks
1. Importing the Libraries
2. Getting Visualising the Data
3. Print the DataFrame Shape and Check for Null Values. 
4. Plotting the True Adjusted Close Value 
5. Setting the Target Variable and Selecting the Features
6. Scaling
7. Splitting to a Training Set and Test Set.
8. Processing the Data For LSTM
9. Building the LSTM Model
10. Training the Model
11. LSTM Prediction
12. True vs Predicted Adj Close Value â€“ LSTM
